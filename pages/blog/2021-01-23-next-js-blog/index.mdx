import Article from "../../../components/Article/Article";

export const description = `NextJS is great for blogging. 
MDX adds more power to that by allowing JSX components to be directly rendered in the blog. 
This post will discuss setup and show examples.`;

export const meta = {
    title: "NextJS blogging with MDX",
    description,
    createdDate: "2021-01-23",
    published: "2021-01-23",
    readTime: 10,
};

export default ({ children }) => <Article meta={meta}>{children}</Article>;

## Moving from Gatsby to NextJS

I started using MDX to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> pages with JS components in side.
This should allow the combination of both worlds.
I am currently using using Gatsby. However, I wanted to move away from it.
GraphQL is annoying and very much overkill for the things I'm trying to do.

This setup is based on the awesome article from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/09/build-blog-nextjs-mdx/" target="_blank">Ibrahima Ndaw on Smashing Magazine</a>.

## Create a new React project

```bash
# Create a new project
npx create-next-app
```

## Add the MDX loaders

The blog articles will be written in MDX.
The following loaders will read and parse `MDX` files to `HTML`.

```bash
# Install loaders
npm i @mdx-js/loader @next/mdx
```

Now that loaders have been installed, they need to be configured.

## Configure `next.config.js` to pickup the MDX files

In `next.config.js` the following configuration ensures that the `MDX` files are read from the pages directory.
Note that other file extensions will also be read.

```javascript
// next.config.js

const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [],
    },
});

module.exports = {
    ...withMDX({
        pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
    }),
    target: "serverless",
};
```

Create the page `test.mdx` in the pages directory. It's now possible to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test`.
That route should now exist.

## Read `/pages/blog/[]/index.mdx` as blog post

All of the blogs will reside in `/pages/blog/`. There a folder is created with an `index.mdx`.
Any other files relevant to the post can also be added there.

In the root of the project create `getAllPosts.js`.

```javascript
// getAllPosts.js

/**
 * For each file in the directory, get the filename
 * and remove the string "index.mdx"
 * @param {*} r
 */
function importAll(r) {
    return r.keys().map((fileName) => ({
        link: fileName.substr(1).replace(/\/index\.mdx$/, ""),
        module: r(fileName),
    }));
}

export const posts = importAll(
    require.context("./pages/blog/", true, /\.mdx$/)
);
```

It loops over the folders in the `/pages/blog` folder and uses those to register them as pages.
That makes `http://localhost:3000/blog/article-name` available.

## A Layout component

All the content will be wrapped by the following `Layout` component.
It renders the meta header tags with `next/head`.
The website `header` and it's `main` content follows that.

```javascript
// /components/Layout.js

import Head from "next/head";
import Header from "./Header/Header";
import styles from "./main.module.css";

const Layout = ({ children, pageTitle, description }) => (
    <>
        <Head>
            <meta
                name="viewport"
                content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
            />
            <meta charSet="utf-8" />
            <meta name="Description" content={description}></meta>
            <title>{pageTitle}</title>
        </Head>
        <Header />
        <main className={styles.mainContent}>{children}</main>
    </>
);

export default Layout;
```

## The article preview in `Post.js` component

The next component required is `ArticleItem.js`.
It will render the article's preview on the listing page.
The component receives a `post` object which contains a `link` property and
a `module` property which contains the post's meta data.

```javascript
// /components/ArticleItem.js

import Link from "next/link";
import ArticleHeader from "./Article/ArticleHeader";

const ArticleItem = ({
    post: {
        link,
        module: { meta },
    },
}) => (
    <article>
        <ArticleHeader meta={meta} />
        <Link href={"/blog" + link}>
            <a>Read more â†’</a>
        </Link>
    </article>
);

export default ArticleItem;
```

## The entire article in `Article.js`

The entire article is displayed with `Article.js` in `/components/Article`.
It also receives the post data which contains the `children` and `meta`.

```javascript
// /components/Article/Article.js

import ArticleHeader from "./ArticleHeader";
import styles from "./article.module.css";

const Article = ({ children, meta }) => (
    <div className={styles.article}>
        <ArticleHeader meta={meta} isBlogPost />
        <article>{children}</article>
    </div>
);

export default Article;
```

## Write a blog post in MDX

Add an article in `/pages/blog/`. In this example it's called `example`.

```javascript

// /pages/blog/example/index.mdx

import Article from "../../../components/Article/Article";

export const description = `some long description
with multiple lines
`;

export const meta = {
    title: "example title",
    description,
    createDate: "01-01-2021",
    publishedDate: "01-01-2021",
    readTime: 2,
};

export default ({ children }) => <Article meta={meta}>{children}</Article>;

## Example secondary title
Some text in the article
```

## Show posts list on the index page

The following code lists all of the posts that it finds in the `blog` folder.
These can then be shown on the listing page.

```javascript
// pages/index.js

import ArticleItem from "../components/ArticleItem/ArticleItem";
import { posts } from "../getAllPosts";
import styles from "./index.module.css";

const publishedPosts = (posts = []) =>
    posts.filter((p) => !!p.module.meta.published);

export default function IndexPage() {
    return (
        <div className={styles.articleListContainer}>
            {publishedPosts(posts).map((post) => (
                <ArticleItem key={post.link} post={post} />
            ))}
        </div>
    );
}
```

The `ArticleItem` component is used to render the posts data based on what has been received from `getAllPosts`.

## use \_app.js to wrap the content

Create `/pages/_app.js`. The `_` tells `NextJS` that this file should **not** be a route.
`NextJS` also recognises `app.js` as an initializer. Here global imports, like `global.css` can be imported.

```javascript
// /pages/_app.js

import Layout from "../components/Layout";
import "../node_modules/prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css";
import "../styles/globals.css";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return (
        <Layout pageTitle="Mytoori Blog" description="Mytoori Blog">
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Layout>
    );
}
```

## MDX code styling (Installation & configuration)

The code should be properly styled for readability. That allows the reader to quickly scan and find the info that is right for her.

```javascript
// code styling example: JS keywords are coloured

const exampleFunctionToDemonstrateCodeStyling = () => {
    const thisIsADemoValue = 1 + 1;
    return thisIsADemoValue;
};
```

For the styling to work, essentially the code text block is split into HTML nodes. Those nodes can now have a color applied to them individually.

### Install the Rehype-prism package

Styling the code is done by [rehype-prism](https://github.com/mapbox/rehype-prism).
It's a plugin for [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) and performs the hightlighting.

```bash
# Install @mapbox/rehype-prism.
npm i @mapbox/rehype-prism
```

### Configure `next.config.js` to use rehype-prism

`next.config.js` exports a configuration object that is read by Next. In that configuration file the plugin is added to `next/mdx`.

```javascript
// import the rehype-prism
const rehypePrism = require("@mapbox/rehype-prism");

// Add the imported component to rehype
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [rehypePrism],
    },
});

// Export a configuration object (which is used by next)
module.exports = {
    ...withMDX({
        pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"],
    }),
    target: "serverless",
};
```

Any `code` component in the MDX file will now be wrapped in an HTML element. That allows CSS styling to be applied.
to do that the following styles are imported.

## Code styles from Prism

In `_app.js` the css styles are imported from the prism package. The previously installed `prism-okaidia.css` has prism as a dependency.
The css files in that package can be directly imported into the project.

Note: other styles are also possible.

```javascript
// /pages/_app.js

import "../node_modules/prismjs/themes/prism-okaidia.css";
```

## Development

Start the development server with the following.

```bash
# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

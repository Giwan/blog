## Preload.js (For security)
At the moment, the contents of the `.jsx` file only renders some basic text. 
The goal is to have a **save button** and a `textarea` with text that should save to a file on the user's computer. 

Saving to the user's computer is an action that the browser will not allow.
It's has security implications. 
While it's possible to disable in an electron app, it should not be. 
That would expose the entire computer to security vulnerabilities. 

### Preload.js allows for secure communication

The app wants to send data to the main electron process where it will be saved to the computer.
That sending and receiving needs to be done securely. Here's how that can be done.

Add a textarea and button to the `index.jsx` file. 

```jsx

// index.jsx

import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import styles from "./app.module.css"; // optional

const App = () => (
    <div className={styles.appContainer}>
        <div className={styles.app}>
        <textarea placeholder="Enter text which should be sent to the main process"></textarea>
        <button>save</button>
        </div>
    </div>
); 

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

```

The styling is optional and can be found in the git repository. 

### Saving
When the save button is clicked, the contents of the textarea should be sent to the main process. 
There the `fs` package from `node` can be used to save the text to disk. 

Start by adding an onClick to the save button. 

```jsx



```

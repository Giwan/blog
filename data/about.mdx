# Hi, I'm Giwan
I'm a front-end dev. In my spare time I try to keep up with what the industry is doing. 
Things are moving fast and it's exciting but I try not to get too carried away as well. 

## My typical dev stack

-   [React](/whatis/react) (create-react-app)
-   Redux
-   React-Router

### Alternatives

-   NextJS (This blog)
-   GatsbyJS (previous version of this blog)
-   Svelte

## Front-end projects with ReactJS

At the end of 2015, I started my first react project.
Since then I've built quite a few interesting projects with it.
Educational and medical tools.
In my free time I often quickly throw something together using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" alt="Create react app link" target="_blank">Create react app</a>
Many of these are publicly available on my remote repositories:

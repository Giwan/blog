As a front-end developer I spend quite a bit of time reading and watching front-end related videos.
These articles help to keep track of some of the interesting content found during that journey.

## My typical dev stack

-   React (create-react-app)
-   Redux
-   React-Router

### Alternatives

-   NextJS (This blog)
-   GatsbyJS (previous version of this blog)
-   Svelte

## Front-end projects with ReactJS

At the end of 2015, I started my first react project.
Since then I've built quite a few interesting projects with it.
Educational and medical tools.
In my free time I often quickly throw something together using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/" alt="Create react app link" target="_blank">Create react app</a>
Many of these are publicly available on my remote repositories:

<Repos />

## Happy with Redux

Using <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" alt="Link to redux website">redux</a> helps to track down issues quickly.
It's somewhat verbose to setup so often it's worth considering if it makes sense for a smaller project.
The component subscribes to the store and reactively updates any changes to the global store object.
Once setup it works as documentation through the code as well.

I have not had the opportunity to try many of the statement libraries available though.
Only flux, in the early days of react.

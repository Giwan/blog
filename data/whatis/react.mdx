# What is React JS?

React started as a JavaScript based UI library. 
Today it's one of the biggest frameworks used in front-end development.

## Why is ReactJS so popular? 

### Developers
Starting out with some great concepts, that quickly resonated with developers. 
There are few frameworks that rely so heavily on pure JavaScript to do most of the work. 
For the majority of the time, one is writing JS. Learning and using React means, becoming a better JS developer. 
Many devs enjoy increasing their skill level. 

### JSX
While React components could be written in Pure JavaScript, there was one area where an abstraction layer was appreciated. 
Creating HTML Elements in pure JS can be tedious and error prone. JSX looks and feels like `HTML` syntax. 
It was easy to learn if you already knew HTML, which many devs typically start with. 
There are edge cases of course but not enough to cause any issues. 
Today `JSX` is recognised as a templating syntax that can also be used in other areas. 

### Facebook money
It probably also helps that a company like Facebook is behind ReactJS. 
They have resources to invest in growing the developer community. 
There are visible and invisible benefits. 

## How does ReactJS work? 
In it's most basic form a web _site_ consists of `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. 
One _can_ write a website with pure `HTML`. `CSS` helps to make it pretty. JS makes it interactive. 

```html
    <!-- pure html example -->
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>This is a simple web site</h1>
            <p>It does not do anything apart from showing these two lines of text</p>
        </body>
    </html>

```

Say the `h1` should be red, CSS could be added to take care of that. 
If the `h1` is clicked though, JS could help to perform some kind of action. 

React, and really any SPA, takes this basic principle and turns it around. 
What if JavaScript is used to write the HTML instead. Then the starting point is a simple website that only takes a JS src file. 

```HTML
    <!-- SPA example -->
    <html>
        <body>
            <div id="root"></div>
        </body>
        <script src="app.js"></script>
    </html>

```

This basic HTML site has nothing in it before the script is executed. 
The script which is the React application creates everything that will be in the entire application. 

The entire web page is therefore created with JavaScript. 
At first glance, this seems great. 
There are some drawbacks to this approach however. 
These are discussed in this article "rendering everything on the client". 

## Reactivity
Reactivity is often one of the main advantages of using a front-end framework versus writing the site with just HTML, CSS and JS. 
Imagine a JavaScript variable with the the name of this blog. A `h1` tag is created to _display_ (a.k.a render) that name on the screen. 
Change the name in JavaScript and the `h1` value remains the same. It has been already been rendered and there is no reason for the `h1` to _react_ to the change in JavaScript. 

This becomes tedious very quickly. The value now needs to be changed in two places. 
Building an application in that model is error prone.

Reactivity solves this. The framework guarantees that if the variable changes in JavaScript, then that change is immediately rendered on screen. 
Building (large scale) apps is now much easier.

# What is a Framework? 

It's possible to write a web application with Vanilla JavaScript. That's JavaScript in it's purest form. 
For example, say a header should be added to an otherwise blank `HTML` page. 

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<body>
    <script>
        const newH1 = document.createElement("h1"); 
        newH1.innerText = "This H1 was created with JavaScript";
        document.body.appendChild(newH1);
    </script>
</body>

```

Extend this concept and an entire web app can be created.
The resulting app will however, is likely very difficult to maintain. 

## Why is a non-framework hard to maintain? 

This can be best illustrated with an example. Everyone has to write a resume at some point. 
The resume styles vary quite wildly. Speak to someone who has to review large amounts however and it will quickly become clear that a standard format would be better. 
Typically personal info, skills, experience, etc. 
If every applicant were to write the CV in a similar _framework_, they can easily review and pick the best candidates. 
The person writing her or his resume also knows exactly how to write it to increase their chances of success. 

A resume is often a single sheet of paper, at most probably three. 
Web applications, if printed, are likely to be a lot more than this. 

A framework therefore helps to structure the application. 
It can also reduce or "black box" some of the code. 

## About Reactivity
It's important to realise that in a web browser, the Document Object Model (DOM) and JavaScript are two separate environments. 
The example above has several extra challenges. The `newH1` holds a reference to a DOM Element. The `H1`. 
While the `newH1` variable is scope the DOM element can be updated and it's values read. 

As the application grows and more DOM Elements are added, this quickly becomes unwieldy. 

Reactivity effectively establishes a link between the JavaScript environment and the DOM. 
Changes to a linked JavaScript variable would immediately update in the DOM and in most cases the other way around. 

# Easier, structured and faster
In conclusion a framework makes it easier to develop a web application. It's not required. It is possible to write an app with Vanilla JS. 
In that case it's up to you to make sure the architectural decisions are sound and will not cause issues later on. 
For enterprise teams this is a major risk. Using a framework means that new developers can get started quickly. They are benefiting from best practices from the community.

# What is MDX

MDX is a variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> . The beauty of it, is that it allows `jsx` components to be inserted. 
Those components are fully interactive. 

## The benefits of MDX
With regular Markdown, the content that is written is static. MDX allows scripting. That means interactive components. 
This can be a simple "to do" list for example, a counter or something much more elaborate. `JSX` can be one simple component or it can be as complex as necessary by composing multiple components together to make a whole.

When blogging about code, the resulting code can easily be demonstrated.

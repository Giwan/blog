# What is Remix
Similar to NextJS, Remix is a react based framework. 
It has some interesting benefits over NextJS though. 

Some of the key benefits are: 
* It's faster (see remix blog post)
* Still works with JavaScript turned off. (SEO, etc.)
* It promotes standard web technology (i.e form submission)

The remix team has outlined [the benefits in great detail in this blog post]( 
https://remix.run/blog/remix-vs-next) I'll just touch on a few things that stood out to me so far.

Like NextJS, it's a full stack framework. 
Some functions run on the server while some (only) run on the client. 
Server side rendering is an important part of all this and Remix handles this as elegantly as NextJS. 

## Loader function
Export a `loader` function in a page and it will run on the server before  getting to the client. 
Get data from an external authenticated API that requires a key. That key will not be seen by the client. 
The resulting data can easily be passed to the client. 
This is akin to NextJS's `getServerSideProps`.

## Action function
Remix allows forms to be submitted like we used to do with `<form action="/my-form-route" method="POST" />` back in the days.
There's no need to intercept the form submission in JavaScript and preventing the default behaviour.
Instead the form submission is received on the server. 
To handle that, an `action` function is exported as well.

## Deployment
Another benefit, that I particularly liked, is the deployment. 
NextJS is created by Vercel, who also offer hosting. 
Naturally NextJS is optimised for deployment on vercel. 

While it's possible to deploy NextJS on other hosting providers, like Netlify, I would frequently encounter an issue. 
This is subjective but Remix has this much better worked out for various hosting providers. 
This is however something that NextJS could easily catchup with though. 

## Summary
All in all I like what Remix is aspiring too. 
I just started playing around with it and so far it's been good.

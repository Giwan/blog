# What is NextJS
NextJS is a framework built on top of ReactJS. 
One of it's major benefits is `server side rendering`. 

With basic ReactJS application, or any SPA for that matter, there is no "server side rendering" out of the box. 
The entire page is built on the client device. So the computer, phone or tablet. 

When a web crawler from a search engine looks at a given website it does not necessarily parse the JavaScript to render the web page. 
Instead the traditional web crawler would expect to see HTML. 

With "server side rendering", NextJS solves this issue. 
It parses the JavaScript on the server and renders the page in HTML before sending it to the client. 
Both the client and the "web crawler" now see the same `HTML`. 

There are many more benefits to using something like NextJS. 

## What are some use cases
There are many cases where a person or company might consider WordPress. 
NextJS can be a better choice. WordPress is inherently unsafe and is very hard to manage for developers. 
That is, if new features need to be added or if the development cycle needs to automated, WordPress can be difficult to manage.

NextJS offers an alternative. 
If it concerns a static site that does not require a backend it's even easier. 
NextJS however can be connected to a backend using an API if necessary. 

Using ReactJS under the hood, NextJS is easy to setup and comes with all the tools needed in a modern development environment. 
For developers already comfortable with React it's easy to get up and running. 

Not having experience with React does not have to be a show stopper however. 
It's relatively easy to learn.
